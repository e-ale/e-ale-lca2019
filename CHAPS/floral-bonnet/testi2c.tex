   {Testing I2C and SPI}

   There are a few more things that need to be installed in order to run
	the I2C and SPI demos. In order to install them we need to get wifi
	working and install a number of Raspbian packages.

   These are beyond the scope of this class and we'll cover them in the upcoming
	I2C and SPI classes.
