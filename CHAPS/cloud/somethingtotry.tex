	{Now lets talk about something to try}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item MQTT - Mosquitto, MQTT broker, good for local passing of data
		\item Think of it as a message bus on the network
		\item Clients Subscribe to Topics that can be hierarchical, and listen to the Topic
		\begin{itemize}
			\item /myhome/groundfloor/livingroom/temperature for example
			\item You can listen at any level of the hierarchy, anything below your level will be filtered to you
			\item Wildcards, +, are allowed /myhome/+/temperature
		\end{itemize}
		\item Devices Publish data to topics
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The data is freeform, the receiving end is expected to interpret it
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
