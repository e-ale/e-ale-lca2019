   {I2C addressing}
   \begin{itemize}
      \item I2C uses a 7-bit address space
	   (though there is a rarely used 10-bit extension)
      \item I2C based devices usually have a range of selectable addresses which allow
	    you to have more than one I2C device on the same bus, or more than one
            of the same kind of I2C device (with a different address)
   \end{itemize}
