   {I2C clock}
   \begin{itemize}
      \item The I2C master tends to drive the clock line, however an I2C slave can
	      hold the SCL line low telling the master to wait in a process
	   which is called \verb?clock stretching?
      \item The SDA line is driven by whomever is currently talking at any
	      particular moment
      \item There are many other details of the I2C protocol which you can read up
	      in the specification or (more easily) on the Wikipedia page
   \end{itemize}
