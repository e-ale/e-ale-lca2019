   {I2C speeds}
   \begin{itemize}
      \item It was initially imagined for low speed inter-chip communications
      \item Although implemented in HW, the lowspeed version of I2C can still
            be implemented via GPIO using \textbf{bit-banging},
            although the HW version is vastly preferred.
      \item HW based versions can run at speeds up to 5 Mbps
   \end{itemize}
