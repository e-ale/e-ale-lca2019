   {sysfs gpio interface is deprecated}
   \begin{itemize}
      \item The sysfs gpio mechanism is actually deprecated in favour of libgpiod
      \item Although the libgpiod set of tools are now the preferred way of handling
	      gpios, platforms like the raspberry-pi have their own utilities
	      like \verb?gpio?
   \end{itemize}
