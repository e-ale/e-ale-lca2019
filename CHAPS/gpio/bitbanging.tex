   {Bit Banging Protocols}
   \begin{itemize}
      \item The best situation is one where dedicated HW can be used to implement
	      HW protocols in the most efficient manner possible
      \item However in situations where you don't have a HW bus controller, or you
	      don't have enough buses, one can elect to sythesize a protocal
              using SW to drive GPIOS appropriately to emulate the bus protocol
      \item This SW implementation of a HW protocol is affectionately known as
	      \textbf{bit banging} in the industry
