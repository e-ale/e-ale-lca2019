   {Open Drain or Open Source}
   \begin{itemize}
      \item Furter more some SoCs have internal pull up and/or pull down resistors
            which can be used to force the value of the pin up or down when the
            pin isn't being driven
      \item \textbf{Open Drain} refers to the situation where a signal usually
	      floats high unless driven low by the value of the GPIO pin
      \item \textbf{Open Source} refers to the situation where a signal usually
	      floats low unless driven high by the value of the GPIO pin
