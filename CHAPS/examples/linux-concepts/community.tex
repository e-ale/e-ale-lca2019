\cprotect\note{

   The \textbf{Linux} community is a far reaching ecosystem of
   developers, vendors and users that supports and
   advances the \textbf{Linux} operating system.

   Vendors and distributors are dependent on developers
   to create and enhance their products.

   Developers are dependent on a robust and active user
   community to submit bugs and suggest improvements.

   These related communities communicate via IRC
   channels, mailing lists, and at conferences, many of which
   are organized by the \textbf{Linux Foundation}.

   On a local level, \textbf{Linux} User Groups
   (\textbf{LUG}s) are a popular way to hold meetings to
   discuss and educate, demonstrate, promote and train
   users on their favorite \textbf{Linux} distributions.
