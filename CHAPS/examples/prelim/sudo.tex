   {sudo and root Privilege}

   \begin{itemize}
      \item
      Some tasks require \textbf{root} (administrator)
      privilege, including:
      \begin{itemize}
         \item
         Changes to system configuration that affect all users
         \item
         Installing new software for all users
         \item
         Accessing certain hardware, such as when
         \textbf{mounting} hard disk partitions
      \end{itemize}
      \item
      Can become root user through use of \textbf{su} command,
      but this requires knowing the root password
      \item
      Better to use \textbf{sudo} because:
      \begin{itemize}
         \item
         Requires only normal user password
         \item
         Privileges can be restricted to only those strictly
         necessary
         \item
         Better logging on the system of such activities
      \end{itemize}
      \item
      Will do a laboratory exercise to ensure your system is
      properly set up to use \textbf{sudo}
   \end{itemize}


\end{frame}

\cprotect\note{

   We will discuss how to set up and use \textbf{sudo} in detail
   in the lab exercise.

   Note that some distributions already set it up at
   install time (e.g., \textbf{Ubuntu}) and others offer it
   as an option to set up at that time (.e.g.,
   \textbf{Fedora}, \textbf{openSUSE}, etc.)
